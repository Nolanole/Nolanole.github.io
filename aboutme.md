After studying Finance at Florida State University in Tallahasse FL, I returned to my homestate and got a law degree from LSU. Somewhere along the way I discovered poker, and after law school graduation, embarked on a decade plus journey as a professional poker player. Sometime in 2017 I got into coding/programming as a hobby, and after considering various bootcamps and other options to further enrich my learning in this field and make a career change, I decided to enroll in the Data Science program at Lambda Scool.

I will be updating this website with blogs, projects, and cool data driven discoveries along my journey as a Data Scientist in training.
